 ### How to change the header 
Switch to the ```Packages.tex``` in the ```Environment```  folder to change the header to your project title

### How to modify the title page

0. Since my ability is limited, I recommend the way by inserting a pdf to address the title page issue :(

    > If you got any good ideas, for example, modify the ````Title Page.tex``` to the format that the international school Academic Affairs Office require, plz drop me a pull request

1. Modify the word file ```TitlePage.docx``` in the ```Environment```  folder
